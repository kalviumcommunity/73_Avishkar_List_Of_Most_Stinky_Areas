# List of Most Stinky Areas in India

A web application that allows users to contribute and view a dynamic list of the most stinky areas across India. This app will allow users to submit, vote on, and explore the areas they believe have the worst odors, based on their experiences.

## Idea

The project aims to create a fun and interactive way to highlight areas with particularly bad odors in India. Users can add their own suggestions of stinky spots, vote on others' submissions, and see the rankings of the stinkiest areas across various cities. The goal is to demonstrate full-stack functionality by implementing features like user login, database management, API creation, and front-end design.

## Features

- **User Login and Authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and maintain their session.
- **Submit Areas**: Users can submit new stinky areas in different cities across India.
- **Vote on Areas**: Users can vote on existing stinky areas to rank them.
- **View List**: A dynamic list that ranks the stinkiest areas based on user votes.
- **Database Integration**: All data (user submissions, votes, rankings) is stored and managed in a database.
- **Admin Features**: Admin users can manage (add, update, delete) stinky areas.
- **Responsive UI**: The app is built using React and Vite, ensuring it's user-friendly on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Deployment**: The front-end and back-end are deployed separately with seamless communication via APIs.
- **Real-time Updates**: As users submit new areas or vote, the list updates in real-time.
- **Data Validation**: Ensuring that users submit only valid, appropriate data for the list.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose
- **Frontend**: React.js, Vite
- **Authentication**: User authentication with session storage
- **APIs**: REST APIs to handle data operations
- **Deployment**: Deployed using a cloud platform like Heroku or AWS
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub for collaboration

## Goals

The goal of this project is to create a fun, engaging, and fully functional application that showcases your skills in full-stack web development, including but not limited to:

- Creating and deploying an API
- Designing and connecting a front-end and back-end
- Managing user authentication and data validation
- Working with a NoSQL database (MongoDB)
- Using modern web development tools and frameworks (React, Vite)
